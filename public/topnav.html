                <h3>How to use:</h3><br><br>
                <h4>The home page:</h4><br>
                Here you can see an example of what a tree will look like.
                <br><br>
                <h4>Trees</h4><br>
                This page shows you all available public trees. To inspect each more closely,
                or to modify family members of a specific tree, click on one of the members of the required tree.
                <br><br>
                <h4>Start a new tree</h4>
                Here you can start a new tree by creating your first member.
                When you start a new tree, you can also specify if ypu want your tree to be public, ie. visible to anyone,
                or private. If you choose private you will need to create a name and a passphrase to your tree. <b>Make sure you keep a record of this,
                  as you will need it to access your tree!</b>
                <h4>Access a private tree</h4>
                If on the previous page you decided to make a private tree, it is on this page you can gain access to it.
                Simply enter the tree name and passphrase you created for the tree and hit submit.<br>
                <br>
                <h4>What can you do to a tree?</h4>
                <li>
                  <b>New Child: </b> Add a new child to an existing member. Due to visualization limitations, you can
                  only add a child to the direct member of the tree (ie. the left-side member of a marriage if the member has a spouse).
                  Just add the name of the parent into the parent name field and then fill the child's information in.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>New Partner/Spouse: </b> Add a partner to an existing member of the tree. Just fill in the member's name in the 
                  partner field, and then add all the information of the partner in.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>New oldest ancestor: </b> The oldest ancestor of a tree is the one furthest up on the tree. If you want to add their
                  parents, just add a new oldest ancestor. Add the new parent's information into the appropriate fields. No need to fill in the
                  parent/partner field.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Delete a member: </b> If you made a mistake and want to get rid of a member, you can do so by deleting the member.
                  Just add the person's name that you want to delete from the tree into the New person name field and hit submit.
                </li>
